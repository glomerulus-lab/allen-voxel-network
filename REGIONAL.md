Generating a regional model
===========================

First edit the following scripts to set the data and output directories, then
run:

     python create_regional_matrices.py
     python run_new_regional_model.py

If you want to compare the output of this model to that from Oh et al. (2014),
this can be accomplished with `compare_new_old.py`.
